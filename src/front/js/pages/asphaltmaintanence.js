        </h1>
        <h3>A GUIDE TO PREVENTIVE ASPHALT MAINTENANCE</h3>
        The following information is provided to help you understand asphalt,
        its capabilities and how to maintain it.
        <br></br> Hot mix asphalt is a mixture of liquid asphalt cement, rock
        and sand. When the three ingredients are combined, they will form a
        flexible, yet durable wear surface.
        <br></br> <h3>From the ground up:</h3> Because the sub-base is generally
        a clay-based soil, which expands and contracts tremendously, the asphalt
        surface is at a disadvantage from the start.
        <br></br> In order to achieve the best results for a new asphalt
        surface, it is recommended that a sub-base of limestone base rock of at
        least four to eight inches in depth should be installed and thoroughly
        compacted prior to the asphalt installation. This sub-base will not flex
        as much as the soil and will allow water to drain through it on a
        consistent basis. The base rock will also provide the stable structural
        support for the asphalt surface.
        <br></br>
        <br></br>
        <h3>WHY ASPHALT FAILS:</h3> There are three main factors as to why an
        asphalt surface will fail:
        <br></br> <h3>Water:</h3>
        Because asphalt is a porous material, it allows water to pass through it
        quite easily. This is from rain and more commonly from the irrigation
        systems used for the landscaping. Once the water starts to penetrate the
        asphalt, it will seep to the sub-base causing the sub-base to “soften”
        and become even more flexible. The asphalt surface can only flex so much
        and in time, it will crack. The greatest water problem is due to the
        freeze thaw cycles that take place each winter and spring. When water is
        frozen it will create 3200 P.S.I. This type of pressure will cause the
        asphalt to flex and break. Even worse is that this scenario occurs over
        and over each season.
        <br></br> <h3>Oxidation:</h3> When a new asphalt surface is installed it
        is very black in color. This is due to the high amount of liquid asphalt
        binder. In time however, asphalt will start to “gray out”. This is
        simply due to the sunlight and oxygen depleting the binder. It is
        similar to a piece of metal that is unpainted. In time, it will rust and
        break down due to its lack of protection from the air.
        <br></br>
        <h3>Petro-chemicals:</h3>
        Fluids such as gas, oil and antifreeze will also break down the
        integrity of an asphalt surface. Because the asphalt is porous, these
        chemicals will also filtrate through the surface breaking down the
        liquid asphalt binder causing the failure of the surface.
        <br></br> Another important factor that will cause asphalt to fail on a
        commercial surface is weight. Trash trucks and Semi-trailers on a
        commercial parking lot are too heavy for the designed load of the
        asphalt. In most cases, the four to six inches of asphalt is designed
        solely for vehicle traffic. That is why you will see failure in front of
        trash dumpsters or along the curb where trucks will deliver their goods.
        <br></br>
        <h3> HOW LONG WILL IT LAST?</h3>
        According to the Asphalt Institute, a commercial parking lots life
        expectancy is thirteen to fifteen years before renovation or replacement
        is needed. This scenario is based on proper base rock sub-grade being
        used.
        <br></br>
        <br></br>
        <h3>PAVEMENT SOLUTIONS:</h3> Knowing what elements effect asphalt and
        how long it is intended to last and what can be done to get the most out
        of an asphalt surface.
        <br></br> The basic solutions for asphalt maintenance are hot rubberized
        joint sealing (crack sealing), asphalt removal and replacement, asphalt
        seal coating, striping and fabric installation and overlay.
        <br></br>
        <br></br>
        <h3>CRACK SEALING:</h3> Water infiltration into the asphalt is the
        number one reason for its failure. As the asphalt surface flexes due to
        the freeze thaw, it cracks. A crack left unattended will eventually
        expand and branch out due to the continuation of the pavement failure.
        Once this scenario occurs you are faced with a condition commonly
        referred to as an “alligatored” area. The asphalt will look like a
        jigsaw puzzle with broken pieces.
        <br></br> The solution to limiting this condition is to crack seal when
        the crack is only a crack and not an alligatored area.
        <br></br>The best crack sealing material to use is a hot rubberized
        crack sealant meeting Federal Specifications ASTM-D-3405 or ASTM D-1190.
        The material is essentially a block of rubber that is heated to 360
        degrees Fahrenheit and applied directly into the crack in a liquid
        state. Once in the crack, it will solidify into its original form. This
        material is used because it provides great flexibility (usually with
        flexibility to twenty degrees below zero) and will not track in the
        summer heat.
        <br></br> Applying the material requires a specific piece of equipment
        called a double jacketed boiler. This piece of equipment uses hot oil to
        circulate around a tank holding the material. The oil circulation avoids
        direct heat to the material in the tank thus providing a consistent
        temperature and product.
        <br></br> What can be crack sealed and what cannot? In order to achieve
        successful results in crack sealing, it is recommended that the crack be
        at least one quarter inch or wider to accept the crack sealing material.
        <br></br> Cracks less than one quarter inch (commonly referred to as
        “hair line” cracks) do not have enough width and depth to support the
        crack sealing material causing them to open in a short period of time.
        <br></br> Crack sealing because of our freeze thaw cycles should be
        performed on at least a two-year basis.
        <br></br>
        <br></br>
        <h3>ALLIGATORED AREAS ARE NOT MEANT TO BE CRACK SEALED.</h3> The hot
        rubberized material is not meant to be used as a “topical” repair. It is
        specifically designed to be used in individual cracks not associated
        with alligatored areas.
        <br></br> <br></br>
        <h3>ASPHALT FAILURE AND REPAIR:</h3> An alligatored area is an
        indication that the asphalt has failed due to one of the many factors
        previously discussed.
        <br></br> Most people will conclude a pothole is asphalt failure when in
        truth; an alligatored area is the beginning of a pothole.
        <br></br> Because this type of area cannot be successfully crack sealed,
        it is recommended that the area be removed and replaced with new hot mix
        asphalt.
        <br></br> Remember that the failure cannot only be attributed to water
        and the freeze thaw cycles, it can also be attributed to base failure
        and weight.
        <br></br> To correct the problem, it needs to be determined if the base
        under the asphalt needs to be replaced or if the asphalt was too thin to
        support the traffic.
        <br></br>If the base has failed, you will usually see a clayish soil
        pumping up through the alligatored area. If no clayish soil is pumping
        through the surface chances are the asphalt has just been placed in too
        thin a lift and needs to be replaced with a greater depth of asphalt.
        <br></br>To repair a failed area, it is recommended to saw cut the
        asphalt approximately eight inches past the point of failure. If the
        base has failed, you will need to dig out the area removing the bad base
        and replace it with either base rock or a thicker amount of asphalt. The
        new base rock should be at least six inches thick and thoroughly
        compacted with a vibratory roller. The ideal area to be patched should
        be squares and rectangles as much as possible. Odd cuts and angles will
        only promote premature failure.
        <br></br>All asphalt repairs should have a depth of at least four to six
        inches depending on the weight expectations of the parking lot. If
        larger vehicles such as Semi-trailers are to be on the asphalt, eight to
        ten inches of asphalt is recommended in order to support the weight of
        the trucks.
        <br></br>The asphalt should be installed in lifts in order to obtain
        proper compaction. Each lift should be thoroughly compacted prior to
        placing the next lift. If all the asphalt is placed in the hole at once,
        proper compaction cannot take place and the asphalt will settle and fail
        prematurely.
        <br></br> It is recommended that failed asphalt in front of trash
        dumpsters be replaced with concrete in order to support the weight of
        the front wheels of the trash truck. The concrete should be reinforced
        with fiber mesh or rebar and should be a minimum depth of six inches.
        <br></br>Once crack sealing and asphalt repair have taken place what
        needs to be done next?
        <br></br>
        <br></br>
        <h3>MODIFIED COAL TAR OR ASPHALT EMULSION SEALING:</h3>
        <br></br> <h3>“Seal coating is just a paint job” NOT TRUE!</h3>
        <br></br>At the beginning of this report, we stated asphalt fails
        because of three factors; water, oxidation and chemicals. If you can
        protect the asphalt from these three elements, does it not make sense
        that it will last longer? The answer is a resounding yes!
        <br></br>The application of a modified sealer will protect the asphalt
        from water, oxidation and chemicals.
        <br></br>A properly applied modified sealer will seal the pores of the
        asphalt thus eliminating water intrusion. If water intrusion is reduced,
        the sub-base stays drier and produces less flexing. Less flexing reduces
        cracks which in turn reduces costly asphalt repairs.
        <br></br>A properly applied sealer will protect the asphalt from the
        three elements that cause failure while providing an attractive, easy to
        maintain surface.
        <br></br>When should seal coating take place? Seal coating should take
        place within the first two years life of the asphalt surface in order to
        provide the greatest benefits. How often should seal coating take place?
        This depends on the amount of traffic on the parking lot. The only way a
        properly applied seal coat will diminish is based on the amount of
        traffic on the material. A McDonalds for example will probably need to
        be sealed every two years due to the higher traffic volume whereas an
        office building parking lot may need to be sealed every three to five
        years.
        <br></br>When you say “modified” and “properly applied” what do you
        mean? A modified sealant is a sealant that is enhanced with a latex
        additive to provide greater fuel resistance, darker color and more
        product flexibility. The sealant is also modified by the addition of
        sand. Sand is used to provide a longer lasting surface life as well as a
        more skid resistant surface.
        <br></br>By properly applied we are stating that the material needs to
        be applied according to and exceeding manufacturer’s specifications. No
        corners are to be cut in the application process.
        <br></br> All commercial seal coating projects should receive two
        individual coats of sealer with a third coat on the main drive lanes and
        entranceways to assure a longer product life against the higher traffic
        volume.
        <br></br>What are the cost advantages of applying a modified sealer? You
        will spend approximately one third of the money to seal coat and
        maintain a lot versus an asphalt overlay while at the same time
        extending the surface life of the asphalt by as much as sixty percent!
        (NOTE: Please see cost comparisons of seal coat versus overlay at the
        end.)
        <br></br>It is obvious that seal coating is an effective and valuable
        tool when it comes to getting the most out of an asphalt surface.
        <br></br>
        <br></br>
        <h3>ASPHALT FABRIC AND OVERLAY:</h3> When an asphalt parking lot has not
        been maintained, it reaches the point where pavement maintenance is no
        longer a viable option. When that time occurs, you are forced to
        consider completely replacing the asphalt or overlaying the surface with
        new asphalt.
        <br></br> Another factor to keep in mind prior to an overlay is the
        concrete curb and gutter surrounding the parking lot. In most cases, you
        cannot overlay over the curbs because you will create a water drainage
        problem. So, the curbs need to be edge milled. This is a process where a
        milling machine will remove two inches of existing asphalt away from the
        curb so the new asphalt will taper and tie into the existing curbs
        allowing proper water flow.
        <br></br>Once the repairs and milling have taken place, it is strongly
        recommended the entire lot be covered in non-woven fabric prior to the
        overlay.
        <br></br>This fabric is placed on a layer of liquid asphalt and is used
        to provide a waterproof membrane between the new and existing asphalt.
        Keeping the water out of the sub-base will provide for a longer overlay
        life and will reduce the reflective cracking that can take place after
        the overlay. If you simply overlay on top of the alligatored asphalt you
        will eventually have all the alligatored cracks reflect through the new
        asphalt and will be in the same position as when you started. Fabrics
        will add to the cost of the overlay, but they are worth every penny
        towards the results.
        <br></br> All overlays should be a minimum of two inches of compacted
        asphalt. Less than two inches will not provide the structural integrity
        you are seeking.
        <br></br>
        <br></br>
        <h3>STRIPING:</h3> Re-striping a parking lot is the least expensive,
        most effective way to upgrade a lot. It is recommended that a parking
        lot be re-striped at least every two years.
        <br></br>Most re-striping takes place in spring when the effects of salt
        and sand are finished for the winter and the lot will have an attractive
        appearance for months to come.
        <br></br>The best machine to use for striping is an airless striper.
        This piece of equipment does not mix air with the paint, providing a
        quality line with little or no overspray. The pump literally applies
        paint only which in turn leaves more paint on the ground and a longer
        life expectancy.

          MAINTENANCE THROUGH CRACK SEALING, SEAL COATING AND STRIPING VERSUS
          MILLING, FABRIC AND OVERLAY:
        </h3>
        Parking lot example is an office building lot based on 8,918 square
        yards using 2021 prices:
        <br></br>Crack seal, Seal coat and Striping:
        <br></br> Year- 2021: Crack, Seal and Stripe: $6,596.70
        <br></br>Year- 2025: Crack, Seal and Stripe: $6,596.70
        <br></br>Year- 2029: Crack, Seal and Stripe: $7,242.60
        <br></br>Year- 2033: Crack, Seal and Stripe: $7,850.00
        <br></br>
        <br></br>Total for four applications over 12 years: $28,286.00
        <br></br>Edge mill, fabric and overlay based on fourteen-year life
        expectancy using 2021 prices.
        <br></br> (Prices will likely be higher in 2033 when work takes place.)
        <br></br>Edge mill: $3,000.00 (based on one day of milling)
        <br></br>Installation of fabric: $20,065.00
        <br></br>Two-inch overlay: $84,275.00
        <br></br>Striping: $927.00
        <br></br>Total for milling, fabric, overlay and striping: $108,267.00
        <br></br>The important factor when looking at the totals is not only the
        difference in cost but realizing the fact that by seal coating, the life
        expectancy of the parking lot can be doubled just in proper maintenance!
        <br></br>Also, keep in mind that you will be providing an incredibly
        attractive, welcoming lot that will be easily maintained for many years
        to come.
        <br></br>
        <br></br>
        <h3>PUTTING IT ALL TOGETHER:</h3> Any asphalt parking lot is a large
        investment. As a Property Owner or Manager, it is our hope that this
        information will allow you to understand just what is involved in your
        investment. Even if you own or manage a parking lot for a short period
        of time, you cannot afford not to maintain it. By performing proper
        maintenance, you will protect your investment, making for an attractive
        parking lot that will help in the resale value of that property. You
        will save money even in the short term by performing pavement
        maintenance such as crack sealing and re-striping.
