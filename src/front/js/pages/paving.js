<h3>Hot Mix Asphalt (HMA)</h3>
<bold>Nashville Asphalt Sealing & Striping</bold> uses hot mix asphalt (HMA), consisting of a combination of crushed aggregate, air and liquid asphalt cement. The proper design of mixes, combination of aggregates, and liquid asphalt cement is essential to the production of durable pavement that will handle loads. We use only the best quality Hot Mix Asphalt to ensure the pavement meets all requirements.
<br></br>

We maintain equipment and qualified paving crews for large metropolitan projects which require the use of multiple pavers, smaller projects such as parking lots, driveways, sidewalks, or specialty projects such as golf cart and bicycle paths, court areas, and race tracks. </p>
